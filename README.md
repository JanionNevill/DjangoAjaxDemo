# DjangoAjaxDemo
A very basic demo of AJAX used in a django app

Contains 2 AJAX demos:
- Button Demo
  - Each click of the button sends a request to get the next Fibonacci number
- Form Demo
  - The submission of the form is blocked and instead send a request to get the Fibonacci number of the given index

Both demos send a request to get the Fibonacci number of a given index, and render the result to the current page.
